            <h3>The Blue Health Phenomenon</h3>
            <p>
              But recently, the “Blue Health” initiative, a European research
              group led by scientists at the University of Exeter in the U.K.,
              has found evidence that spending time in or around water may be
              just as beneficial to human health as spending time in green
              spaces. “You can take almost all the green-space research, sub in
              the word blue, and find a lot of the same effects,” says Wallace
              J. Nichols, PhD, a marine biologist and former senior scientists
              at the non-profit Ocean Conservancy. “Green space is good, but add
              a pond or a fountain or a lakeshore and it’s better.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Nichols is the author of Blue Mind, a book that explores the
              benefits of time spent in or around water. He says that being near
              water is naturally calming, which may help explain why so many of
              us seek out beaches or other water-adjacent destinations during
              our vacations. But water does more than combat stress or induce a
              state of relaxation. “Water is also a source of creativity and
              inspiration,” he says. “When you look at water, there’s what
              people describe as this soft fascination — something that is
              interesting and that holds your attention, but not in an
              information-rich way.”

                <p>
                  Taughnnock Falls is one of the most treasured natural
                  attractions in the northeast. Impressively, it’s the tallest
                  free-falling waterfall east of the Rocky Mountains. It drops
                  down 215 feet. The Taughnnock Falls State Park, named after
                  the massive waterfall, has several hiking trails to explore.
                  Each at varying levels of difficulty. There’s also kayaking,
                  fishing, swimming, paddleboarding, and more.

                <h4>Eternal Flame Falls</h4>
                <p>
                  Eternal Flames Falls is unlike any other waterfall in New
                  York. That’s because, underneath its rushing flow of water,
                  you’ll see a tiny little flame flickering. There are only nine
                  of these ‘eternal flame’ waterfalls in the entire world. There
                  are a bunch of different legends that surround the Eternal
                  Flame Falls. Mainly about how it’s a symbol for eternal life.
                  But scientifically, it’s the result of a natural gas leak just
                  below the surface.

                <p>
                  A picturesque 167-foot waterfall is the main attraction of
                  Chittenango Falls State Park! Glacial sculpting over 400
                  million-year-old bedrock is responsible for this scenic
                  feature. Visitors can view the falls from the top, walk the
                  winding trail into the gorge view the falls from the
                  footbridge and return to the top along the small trail on the
                  opposite side of the gorge.
