            <h3>The Blue Health Phenomenon</h3>
            <p>
              But recently, the “Blue Health” initiative, a European research
              group led by scientists at the University of Exeter in the U.K.,
              has found evidence that spending time in or around water may be
              just as beneficial to human health as spending time in green
              spaces. “You can take almost all the green-space research, sub in
              the word blue, and find a lot of the same effects,” says Wallace
              J. Nichols, PhD, a marine biologist and former senior scientists
              at the non-profit Ocean Conservancy. “Green space is good, but add
              a pond or a fountain or a lakeshore and it’s better.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Nichols is the author of Blue Mind, a book that explores the
              benefits of time spent in or around water. He says that being near
              water is naturally calming, which may help explain why so many of
              us seek out beaches or other water-adjacent destinations during
              our vacations. But water does more than combat stress or induce a
              state of relaxation. “Water is also a source of creativity and
              inspiration,” he says. “When you look at water, there’s what
              people describe as this soft fascination — something that is
              interesting and that holds your attention, but not in an
              information-rich way.”
